# backpropagation
This project introduces a rudimentary approach to backpropagation with a feedforward neural network. The multilayered perceptron model is built from the ground up using only Python's standard libraries. As its loss function, the model uses mean squared error. A network object can be saved to and uploaded from json.

The relevant mathematics can be found in 3Blue1Brown's video series [Neural networks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&si=ZHQVZqUEgnU43_X4) and on his [website](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks).
